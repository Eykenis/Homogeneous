# Homogeneous

Homogeneous **is nearly to be** a stylized voxel renderer written by C++ and CUDA. It is not yet usable.

# Currently aiming to do

- [x] .VOX format supports.
- [x] Ray casting rendering for voxels.
- [x] Octree-based LOD voxel generation & rendering.
- [ ] MagicaVoxel-like Greedy meshing for voxels, seperating ray casting for other volume rendering(volume fogs, etc.) for better performance on opaque objects.
- [ ] Perlin-noise terrain generation.
